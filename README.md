# Face Detection App

This open-source Face Detection App utilizes the Viola-Jones Algorithm to detect faces in real-time using your webcam. It's a simple and educational project that demonstrates the basics of face detection.

## Features

- Real-time Face Detection: Detect faces using your webcam in real-time.
- Viola-Jones Algorithm: Utilizes the Viola-Jones algorithm for efficient face detection.
- Easy to Use: A user-friendly interface for starting and stopping face detection.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

2. Install the required dependencies by running the following command:

   ```bash
   pip install streamlit


## Usage

-Launch the app using the provided instructions.

-Click the "Detect Faces" button to start real-time face detection with your webcam.

-Detected faces will be highlighted with green rectangles.

-Press 'q' to stop face detection and exit the app.

## Dependencies

-OpenCV: Used for image processing and the Viola-Jones face detection algorithm.
-Streamlit: Used for creating the user interface.
